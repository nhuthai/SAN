# SAN
This project aims to create social audio network for the blind, drivers or those who are bored of watching the screen. Users can hear the (authorized) individual voice of their friends to obtain what they share instead of looking the screen. To do this, we use Machine Learning to analyze individually auditory patterns and Audio Coding to change the common voice to the individual voice.

# Text to Voice (T2V)
Use mutual information to group words which usually occur together and record voice of these group in order to make the speech smoother.
